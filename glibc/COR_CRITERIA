 EASY: all the correspondences should exhibit some seen control flow
       all seen control flow should be exhibited in correspondences

 1. We need coverage of target and rewrite states.
 2. It's best for memory to line up after each transition.
 3. We don't want one program looping while the other isn't.
 4. We would like the correspondence between registers to be as strong as possible.


STOP POINTS METHOD:

  - choose "stop" points, make cartesian product, consider all correspondences where nobody loops by themselves

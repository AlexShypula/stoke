        section     manual vect.    inv classes work notes
strlen    5.3          yes          yes
strnlen   5.3          yes
memset    5.4          yes          think so
memcpy    5.7          yes                            looks hard
memchr    5.9          yes          think so          looks interesting!
strchr    5.9          yes                            also interesting!














non-examples

memcpy - uses page copying
5.5 - these use other functions
5.6 - these use other functions (would be good to double check -- not totally sure)
5.7 - strcmp not vectorized  
5.8 -- not sure, have to investigate macros
5.10 - don't look vectorized
5.11 - uses memset
5.12 - no vectorization, uses randomness
5.13 - no vectorization
5.14, 5.15 - not vectorized

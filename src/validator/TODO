Possible improvements
  - remove unnecessary invariants before generating constraints
      (i.e. those that contrain unneeded registers)
  - counterexample check should only consider registers that are
    defined
  - debug specific obligations that take too long
  - shorter failure edges
  - implication graph with equalities over registers
      ( implies equalities over all subregisters )
  - improve fixpoint algorithm
      a. only consider infeasible edges at the end (?)
      b. don't ignore errors
  - workers use priority order for solvers / memory models
  - add more solvers for tough problems
  - obligation checker using local parallelism

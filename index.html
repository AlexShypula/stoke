<p>STOKE is a stochastic optimizer for the x86-64 instruction set. STOKE uses
random search to explore the extremely high-dimensional space of all possible
program transformations. Although any one random transformation is unlikely to
produce a code sequence that is both correct and an improvement over the
original, the repeated application of millions of transformations is sufficient
to produce novel and non-obvious code sequences that have been shown to
outperform the code produced by general-purpose and domain-specific compilers,
and in some cases expert hand-written code.</p>

<p>STOKE has appeared in a number of publications. For a thorough introduction to
the design of STOKE, see:</p>

<p>STOKE will run on modern 64-bit x86 processors.  We officially support Haswell
processors with AVX2 extensions.  STOKE should also run on Sandy Bridge
systems (with AVX, but not AVX2), and Nehalem systems without either extension.</p>

<p>To check what level of hardware support you have, run:</p>

<pre><code>$ less /proc/cpuinfo
</code></pre>

<p>and check if the following cpu flags are present:</p>

<pre><code>flags: ... avx avx2 bmi bmi2 popcnt ...
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have 'avx' or 'avx2', you will need to compile for nehalem.  If
you have 'avx', but not avx2, you will compile for 'sandybridge'.  If you have
both, you can compile for 'haswell'.  Build instructions are in the next
section.</p>

<p>STOKE is supported on the latest Ubuntu LTS release; in practice, it will also
run on Ubuntu 13.10+ and on debian testing.  If you're trying to get STOKE to
work on another linux distribution, having the right version of g++ is key.
STOKE is supported on 4.9 only.
It should also work on later versions, but it will not work with g++ 4.8.x (missing regular expression support), and  g++ 4.7.x and older
definitely will not work.</p>

<p>Most of STOKE's software dependencies are available through apt. These can be
satisfied by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install bison ccache cmake doxygen exuberant-ctags flex g++-4.9 g++-multilib gcc-4.9 ghc git libantlr3c-dev libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev libcln-dev libghc-regex-compat-dev libghc-regex-tdfa-dev libghc-split-dev libjsoncpp-dev python subversion libiml-dev libgmp-dev
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the dependencies will be fetched automatically as part of the build
process.</p>

<h1>
<a id="downloading-stoke" class="anchor" href="#downloading-stoke" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Downloading STOKE</h1>

<p>The entire STOKE code base is available on GitHub under the Apache Software
License version 2.0 at <a href="https://github.com/StanfordPL/stoke/">github.com/StanfordPL/stoke</a>.</p>

<p>To check it out, type:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/StanfordPL/stoke
</code></pre>

<p>This will check out the default <code>develop</code> branch.  Unless you are looking for a specific version or modification of STOKE, this is the branch to use.  It contains all the latest changes and is reasonably stable.  This branch is supposed to always pass all tests.</p>

<h1>
<a id="building-stoke" class="anchor" href="#building-stoke" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building STOKE</h1>

<p>See the previous sections on how to download STOKE, a list of dependencies, and to check your hardware
support level.  The remainder of STOKE's software dependencies are available on
GitHub and will be downloaded automatically the first time that STOKE is built.  When you build STOKE the first time, run</p>

<pre><code>$ ./configure.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This will figure out the correct build parameters (such as the platform).  To build STOKE, run</p>

<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>

<p>To add STOKE and its related components to your path, type:</p>

<pre><code>$ export PATH=$PATH:/&lt;path_to_stoke&gt;/bin
</code></pre>

<p>To run the tests, choose the appropriate command:</p>

<pre><code>$ make test
</code></pre>

<p>The files generated during the build process can be deleted by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ make clean
</code></pre>

<p>To delete STOKE's dependencies as well (this is useful if an error occurs during the first build), type:</p>

<pre><code>$ make dist_clean
</code></pre>

<a id="using-stoke" class="anchor" href="#using-stoke" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using STOKE</h1>

<p>The following toy example shows a typical workflow for using STOKE. All of the
following code can be found in the <code>examples/tutorial/</code> directory.  As this
code is tested using our continuous integration system, the code there will
always be up-to-date, but this README can fall behind.</p>

<p>Consider a
C++ program that repeatedly counts the number of bits (population count) in the
64-bit representation of an integer. (Keeping track of a running sum prevents
<code>g++</code> from eliminating the calls to <code>popcnt()</code> altogether.)</p>

<p>STOKE is a compiler and programming language agnostic optimization tool. It can
be applied to any x86-64 ELF binary. Although this example uses the GNU
toolchain, nothing prevents the use of other tools. To build this code with
full optimizations, type:</p>

<pre><code>$ g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -fno-inline main.cc
</code></pre>

<p>To measure runtime, type:</p>

<pre><code>$ time ./a.out 100000000

real  0m1.046s
user  0m1.047s
sys   0m0.000s
</code></pre>

<p>A profiler will reveal that the runtime of <code>./a.out</code> is dominated by calls to
the <code>popcnt()</code> function. STOKE can be used to improve the implementation of
this function as follows. The first step is to disassemble the program by
typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ stoke extract -i ./a.out -o bins
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce a directory named <code>bins</code> that contains the text of every
function contained in the binary <code>./a.out</code>. </p>

<p>Help for stoke or any of its subcommands can be obtained by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ stoke -h
$ stoke &lt;subcommand&gt; -h
</code></pre>

<p>STOKE can accept arguments either through the command line or through a
configuration file. The invocation of <code>stoke extract</code> shown above is equivalent
to the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ stoke extract --config extract.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>extract.conf</code> contains:</p>

<pre><code>##### stoke extract config file

-i ./a.out # Path to the elf binary to disassemble
-o bins # Path to the directory to store disassembled text in
</code></pre>

<p>Every STOKE subcommand can be used to generate example configuration files by
typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ stoke &lt;subcommand&gt; --example_config &lt;path/to/file.conf&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>main.cc</code> was compiled using <code>g++</code>, the text of the <code>popcnt()</code> function
will appear under the mangled name <code>_Z6popcntm</code> in <code>bins/_Z6popcntm.s</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-asm-x86"><pre>  <span class="pl-s">.text</span>
  .globl _Z6popcntm
  .type _Z6popcntm, @function
<span class="pl-en">_Z6popcntm:</span>

  <span class="pl-k">je</span>     .L_4005b0
  <span class="pl-k">nop</span>
<span class="pl-en">.L_4005a0:</span>

<span class="pl-en">.L_4005b0:</span>
  retq
  <span class="pl-k">nop</span>
  <span class="pl-k">nop</span>
  .size _Z6popcntm, .-_Z6popcntm</pre></div>

<p>The next step is to generate a set of testcases for guiding STOKE's search
procedure. These can be obtained by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ stoke testcase --config testcase.conf
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>testcase.conf</code> contains:</p>

<pre><code>##### stoke testcase config file

--bin ./a.out # The name of the binary to use to generate testcases 
--args 10000000 # Command line arguments that should be passed to ./a.out
--functions bins # Disassembly directory created by stoke extract

-o popcnt.tc # Path to file to write testcases to

--fxn _Z6popcntm # The name of the function to generate testcases for
--max_testcases 1024 # The maximum number of testcases to generate. 
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting file will contain 1024 entires, all of the form:</p>

<pre><code>Testcase 0:

</code></pre>

<p>Each entry corresponds to the hardware state that was observed just prior to an
execution of the <code>popcnt()</code> function. The first 60 rows represent the contents
of general purpose, sse, and eflags registers, and the remaining rows represent
the contents of memory, both on the stack and the heap. Memory is shown eight
bytes at a time, where a block of eight bytes appears only if the target
dereferenced at least one of those bytes. Each row contains values and state
flags. Bytes are flagged as either (v)alid (the target dereferenced this byte),
  or (.)invalid (the target did not dereference this byte). </p>

<p>Each of the random transformations performed by STOKE are evaluated with
respect to the contents of this file. Rewrites are compiled into a sandbox and
executed beginning from the machine state represented by each entry. Rewrites
are only permitted to dereference defined locations. This includes registers
that are flagged as <code>def_in</code> (see <code>search.conf</code>, below), memory locations that
are flagged as 'v', or locations that were written previously. Rewrites are
permitted to write values to all registers and to any memory location that is
flagged as valid. </p>

<p>STOKE will produce optimal code that works on the testcases.  The testcases
need to be selected to help ensure that STOKE doesn't produce an incorrect
rewrite.  In our main.cc file in <code>examples/tutorial</code> we choose arguments to the
<code>popcnt</code> function to make sure that it sometimes provides arguments that use
more than 32 bits.  Otherwise, STOKE will sometimes produce a rewrite using the
<code>popcntl</code> instruction, which only operates on the bottom half of the register,
instead of the <code>popcntq</code> instruction, which operates on the whole thing.
  Alternatively you can use the formal validator in bounded mode with a large
  bound (over 32).  This large bound is tractable because this example doesn't
  has a small number of cases for memory aliasing (namely, none at all!).  If a
  counterexample is found it can be automatically added to the search so STOKE
  won't make this mistake again.</p>

<p>The STOKE sandbox will safely halt the execution of rewrites that perform
undefined behavior. This includes leaving registers in a state that violates
the x86-64 callee-save ABI, dereferencing invalid memory, performing a
computation that results in a floating-point exception, or becoming trapped in
a loop that performs more than <code>max_jumps</code> (see <code>search.conf</code>, below). </p>

<p>The final step is to use these testcases and the target code contained in
<code>bins/_Z6popcntm.s</code> to run STOKE search by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ stoke search --config search.conf
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>search.conf</code> contains:</p>

<pre><code>##### stoke search config file

--out result.s # Path to write results to

--target bins/_Z6popcntm.s # Path to the function to optimize
--init empty # Begin search from all nops

<p>When search has run to completion, STOKE will write the lowest cost verified
rewrite that it discovered to <code>result.s</code>. Because this is a particularly simple
example, STOKE is almost guaranteed to produce the optimal rewrite:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-asm-x86"><pre>  <span class="pl-s">.text</span>
  .globl _Z6popcntm
  .type _Z6popcntm @function
<span class="pl-en">_Z6popcntm:</span>
  popcnt %rdi, %rax
  retq
  .size _Z6popcntm, .-_Z6popcntm</pre></div>

<p>This result can then be patched back into the original binary by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ stoke replace --config replace.conf
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>result.conf</code> contains:</p>

<pre><code>##### stoke replace config file

-i ./a.out # Path to the elf binary to patch
--rewrite result.s # Path to the replacement function
</code></pre>

<p>And runtime can once again be measured by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ time ./a.out 100000000

real  0m0.133s
user  0m0.109s
sys   0m0.000s    
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, the results are close to an order of magnitude faster than the original.</p>

<a id="using-the-formal-validator" class="anchor" href="#using-the-formal-validator" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using the Formal Validator</h2>

<p>STOKE includes a formal validator.  It's design and interface
are detailed in the <code>src/validator/README.md</code> file.  To use the formal
validator instead of hold out testing, specify <code>--strategy bounded</code> for any
STOKE binary that you use.  For code with loops, all paths will be explored up
to a certain depth, specified using the --bound argument, which defaults to 2.</p>

<p>An example of using the validator can be found in the <code>examples/pairity</code>
folder; this example has a Makefile much like the tutorial's and should be easy
to follow.  The key difference is that the pairity example does not use
testcases to guide search.  Instead, after producing a candidate rewrite,
the validator checks for equivalence.  If the codes are not equivalent, 
a counterexample is found, and this is used as a new testcase to help guide search.</p>

<p>There are some important limitations to keep in mind while using the validator:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only some instructions are supported.  The <code>--validator_must_support</code> flag
can be used to only propose instructions that can be validated.</li>
<li>Only the general purpose registers, SSE registers (<code>ymm0</code>-<code>ymm15</code>) and five of
the status flags (<code>CF</code>, <code>SF</code>, <code>PF</code>, <code>ZF</code>, <code>OF</code>) are supported.</li>
<li>Memory is now fully supported, even in the presence of complex aliasing.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="additional-features" class="anchor" href="#additional-features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Features</h1>

<p>STOKE can not only propose instructions when searching for programs, but also propose calls to a list of known functions using the <code>--functions</code> command-line argument.  To decide whether these functions read any undefined state (before proposing them), we use a dataflow analysis.  Sometimes, the dataflow analysis can be too imprecise, which is why STOKE allows the user to annotate dataflow information in comments.  Here is an example of a function that clears the overflow flag.  STOKEs dataflow analysis is too imprecise for this code.</p>

<pre><code>  .text
  .globl clear_of
  .type clear_of, @function
#! maybe-read { }
#! maybe-write { %of %r15 }
#! maybe-undef { }
.clear_of:
  pushfq
  popq %r15
  andq $0xfffff7ff, %r15
  pushq %r15
  popfq
  retq

.size clear_of, .-clear_of
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it is enough to specify the maybe sets, as STOKE will automatically realize that the must sets need to be contained in the maybe set.</p>

<h2>
<a id="gadgets" class="anchor" href="#gadgets" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gadgets</h2>

<p>The stoke codebase is setup in a very modular way.  We have components like the
<code>Sandbox</code>, which emulates execution of a rewrite on hardware.  Or, we have
subclasses of <code>CostFunction</code> which evaluate the quality of a rewrite.  Or, we
have an <code>SMTSolver</code> which is used by the formal validator to query a backend
like Z3 or CVC4.  </p>

<p>Often, several stoke applications will wish to configure one of these modules
in the same way, depending on command line arguments.  Thus, we have "Gadgets".
A "Gadget" is a subclass of the class you wish to configure which takes care of
extracting all the appropriate command line arguments.  Some Gadgets, like
<code>SandboxGadget</code> just define a constructor so that modifies the object's
configuration.  More involved ones, like <code>CostFunctionGadget</code> actually do work
to create a new <code>CostFunction</code> object and define methods that act as a wrapper.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to add a command line option to an existing component of
stoke, you normally are going to want to modify the gadget for that component
in <code>tools/gadgets</code> and add the argument in <code>tools/args</code>.  Once you do that, it
should show up uniformly in all of the stoke tools that use that module.</p>

<h2>
<a id="search-transformations" class="anchor" href="#search-transformations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search Transformations</h2>

<p>Transformation types are defined in the <code>src/transform</code> directory.  Each
transform is a subclass of the abstract class <code>Transform</code>.  Existing transforms are,</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>add_nops</td>
<td>Adds one extra nop instruction into the rewrite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>delete</td>
<td>Deletes one instruction at random.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>instruction</td>
<td>Replaces an instruction with another one chosen at random.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>opcode</td>
<td>Replaces an instruction's opcode with a new one that takes operands of the same type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>operand</td>
<td>Replaces an operand of one instruction with another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rotate</td>
<td>Formerly "resize".  Moves an instruction from one basic block to another, and shifts all the instructions in between.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>local_swap</td>
<td>Takes two instructions in the same basic block and swaps them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>global_swap</td>
<td>Takes two instructions in the entire program and swaps them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>weighted</td>
<td>Selects from among several other transforms at random.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>These subclasses each implement <code>operator()(Cfg&amp; cfg)</code> to mutate a Cfg.  This
function returns an object, <code>TransformInfo</code> that contains all the information
needed to undo this transformation, and also whether the transform succeeded
(transforms are allowed to fail).  It's common for this object to be set with
indexes of instructions in the code that were modified, for example.  The
subclass also implements <code>undo(Cfg&amp; cfg, TransformInfo ti)</code>.</p>

<p>Transforms will often want to select from a collection of operands and opcodes,
and for this purpose they can access the <code>pools_</code> protected variable of the
Transform<code>superclass.  This is of type</code>TransformPools<code>and allows access to
these collections.  This makes it possible to configure the collection of
available opcodes and operands independently of the transforms.  Also, the
</code>Transform<code>superclass has a</code>gen_` member which is used to produce random
numbers with a known seed.</p>

<p>Transformation weights are specified using the family of <code>--xxxxx_mass</code> command
line arguments. These values control the distribution of proposals that are
made by the WeightedTransform, which is the transform used by the
search.</p>

<p>A simple example of how to impelement a transform is in
<code>src/transform/global_swap.cc</code>.  Note that all transforms must appropriately
make a call to recompute any <code>Cfg</code> information that needs to be updated and
ensure that <code>cfg.check_invariants()</code> returns true when done (you can assume it
    returns true at the beginning of the function).</p>

<h2>
<a id="cost-function" class="anchor" href="#cost-function" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cost Function</h2>

<p>A cost function is specified using the <code>--cost</code> command line argument.  It's an
expression composed using standard unsigned arithmetic operators.  As
variables, you can use several measurements of the current rewrite.  The most
important of these is <code>correctness</code>.  The value <code>correctness</code> is (by default)
the number of bits that differ in the outputs of the target versus the rewrite
summed across all testcases.  There are some tunable options for this, for
example, for floating point computations.  In all cases, lower cost is better.</p>

<p>Some other important cost-variables you can use are:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>binsize</td>
<td>The size (in bytes) of the assembled rewrite using the x64asm library.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>correctness</td>
<td>How "correct" the rewrite's output appears.  Very configurable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>size</td>
<td>The number of instructions in the assembled rewrite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>latency</td>
<td>A poor-man's estimate of the rewrite latency, in clock cycles, based on the per-opcode latency table in <code>src/cost/tables</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>measured</td>
<td>An estimate of running time by counting the number of instructions actually executed on the testcases.  Good for loops and algorithmic improvements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sseavx</td>
<td>Returns '1' if both avx and sse instructions are used (this is usually bad!), and '0' otherwise.  Often used with a multiplier like <code>correctness + 1000*sseavx</code>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nongoal</td>
<td>Returns '1' if the code (after minimization) is found to be equivalent to one in <code>--non_goal</code>.  Can also be used with a multiplier.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In typical usage, you will combine the value of <code>correctness</code> with other values
you want to optimize for.  A good starting point is <code>correctness + measured</code> or
<code>correctness + latency</code> (the latter being default).  Improvements might assign
an SSE-AVX penalty, like <code>correctness + latency + 10000*sseavx</code>.</p>

<p>To add a new cost function, drop a file into <code>src/cost</code> that subclasses
<code>stoke::CostFunction</code>.  Look at <code>src/cost/sseavx.h</code> for a simple example.  It
comes down to overloading the <code>operator()</code> function to return the value you
want.  Look at <code>measured.h</code> for an example of how to use runtime data from the
sandbox to generate values.  Then, add an entry to the map in
<code>tools/gadgets/cost_function.h</code> so that your new function can be found on the
command line.</p>

<h2>
<a id="verification-strategy" class="anchor" href="#verification-strategy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Verification Strategy</h2>

<p>The verification strategy specifies what kind of verification to do on the
rewrite.  It's controlled using the <code>--strategy</code> command line argument.  Right
now, the options are 'hold_out', 'straight_line' or 'bounded'.</p>

<h2>
<a id="command-line-args" class="anchor" href="#command-line-args" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Command Line Args</h2>

<p>Command line arguments can be added to any of the STOKE subcommands using the
following syntax. Argument separators which are printed as part of help
messages are specified by defining a heading variable:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-c++"><pre><span class="pl-k">auto</span>&amp; heading = Heading::create(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Heading Description:<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>);</pre></div>

<p>Command line flags are specified by declaring a <code>FlagArg</code>.</p>

<pre lang="c+++"><code>auto&amp; flag = FlagArg::create("flag_name")
  .alternate("alternate_flag_name")
  .description("What this flag does");
</code></pre>

<p>Any of the built-in c++ primitive types are specified by declaring a <code>ValueArg</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-c++"><pre><span class="pl-k">auto</span>&amp; val = ValueArg&lt;<span class="pl-k">int</span>&gt;::create(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>value_name<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .alternate(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>alternate_value_name<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .usage(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>&lt;int&gt;<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .description(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>What this value represents<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .default_val(<span class="pl-c1">0</span>);</pre></div>

<p>User-defined types are specified by additionally providing function objects that define I/O methods.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-c++"><pre><span class="pl-k">struct</span> <span class="pl-en">T</span> {
  <span class="pl-k">int</span> x, y, z;
};

<span class="pl-k">struct</span> <span class="pl-en">Reader</span> {
  <span class="pl-k">void</span> <span class="pl-en">operator</span>()(istream&amp; is, T&amp; t) <span class="pl-k">const</span> {
    is &gt;&gt; t.<span class="pl-smi">x</span> &gt;&gt; t.<span class="pl-smi">y</span> &gt;&gt; t.<span class="pl-smi">z</span>;
  }
};

<span class="pl-k">struct</span> <span class="pl-en">Writer</span> {
  <span class="pl-k">void</span> <span class="pl-en">operator</span>()(ostream&amp; os, <span class="pl-k">const</span> T&amp; t) <span class="pl-k">const</span> {
    os &lt;&lt; t.<span class="pl-smi">x</span> &lt;&lt; <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span> <span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> &lt;&lt; t.<span class="pl-smi">y</span> &lt;&lt; <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span> <span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> &lt;&lt; t.<span class="pl-smi">z</span>;
  }
};

<span class="pl-k">auto</span>&amp; val = ValueArg&lt;T, Reader, Writer&gt;::create(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>value_name<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .alternate(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>alternate_value_name<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .usage(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>&lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .description(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>What this value represents<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .default_val({<span class="pl-c1">0</span>,<span class="pl-c1">0</span>,<span class="pl-c1">0</span>});</pre></div>

<p>For complex values that are better suited to being read from files, a <code>FileArg</code>
may be more appropriate than a <code>ValueArg</code>. The syntax is identical.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-c++"><pre><span class="pl-k">auto</span>&amp; val = FileArg&lt;Complex, ComplexReader, ComplexWriter&gt;::create(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>value_name<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .alternate(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>alternate_value_name<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .usage(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>&lt;complex representation&gt;<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .description(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>What this value represents<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
  .default_val(Complex());</pre></div>

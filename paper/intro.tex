\section{Introduction}

Equivalence checking is a long-standing yet important problem.  In both
equivalence checking and relational verification, many state-of-the-art
algorithms depend upon a simulation or bisimulation relation.  These relations
ultimately relate both the data of the two programs (e.g. by \emph{invariants})
but also the control flow.  However, past works have generally been very
limitted in this latter respect; automatically finding relationships between
the control flow of one program and the control flow of another typically
requires unrealistic assumptions.  

We address this problem in a data-driven context, such as superoptimization, where there are readily available test cases that

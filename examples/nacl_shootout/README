To make these experiments repeatable, we'll organize directories as follows:

=== PERMANENT ===

Makefile
  - testcase: generates all testcases needed for all components
  - search: runs stoke_search, possibly multiple times if synthesis is needed
  - replace: runs stoke_replace to copy the new code into a binary
  - deploy: runs 'replace' and copies the new binary into the NaCl folder
  - bench: (not yet implemented) runs the binary and measures performance
  - clean: removes all files that we can (except the ones below)

original.s
  - a copy of the original code

target.s
  - a copy of the code for search
  - may need to be fixed to work-around parsing bugs
  - manually transformed if working from a non-NaCl toolchain
  - fix any rip offsets in the header

search.conf
  - all the config required to do the search

binary and/or binary.o
  - the original binary with the code to optimize

results/
  - any saved results from past runs

.gitignore
  - to hide all the stuff that should be from git.

=== TEMPORARY ===

optbin
  - the optimized binary

result.s
  - the fully optimized code produced by the search

testcases
  - all testcases generated

extract/
  - the extracted source from the binaries
  - git ignore'd

debug/
  - any temporary stuff used in debugging
  - git ignore'd

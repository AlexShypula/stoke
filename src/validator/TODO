Possible improvements
  - implication graph with equalities over registers
      ( implies equalities over all subregisters )
  - improve fixpoint algorithm
      a. only consider infeasible edges at the end (?)
      b. don't ignore errors
  - workers use priority order for solvers / memory models
  - add more solvers for tough problems
  - obligation checker using local parallelism

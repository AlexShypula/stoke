\section{Background}


\subsection{Bisimulation Relations}

The mathematical definition of a bisimulation relation specifies
a correspondence between two state transition systems, and in the
equivalence checking literature bisimulation relations are widely
used to prove equivalence of programs. \todo{say a little more here;
perhaps provide definition of bisimulation relation}

The basic technique for building a bisimulation relations between two
programs is to identify a set of \emph{cutpoints}. A cutpoint is a
program point in the target and a corresponding program point in the
rewrite. The states in the transition system of each program consist
of a pair $(C, \sigma)$ where $C$ is a cutpoint and $\sigma$ is a
machine state encoding the values of all the registers and memory
locations. A bisimulation relation is induced by choosing an invariant
$I$ that relates the machine states at the two programs for each
cutpoint. We say that states $(C, \sigma)$ and $(C, \sigma')$ are
related if an only if $I(\sigma, \sigma')$ hold. \todo{cite pldi2000
or Bansal's undef paper}. \todo{explain how bisimulation relations
in the past encoded some assumptions about paths that reach program
points}

\subsection{Modules and $\Z{n}$}

On processors, arithmetic does not happen over $\mathbb{Z}$, but
rather over a space of bitvectors. Mathematically, we can model
an $n$-bit bitvector as an element of $\Z{n}$, that is integers
modulo $2^n$. In the course of our work, we deal with vectors and
matrices over $\Z{n}$ and compute solutions to linear equations over
matrices. However, because the space $\Z{n}$ is not a field, but
rather only a commutative ring, the traditional treatment of linear
algebra does not fully apply. Instead of \emph{vector spaces} we
have \emph{$\Z{n}$-modules}. There are many parallels between vector
spaces and modules, and we need not dwell on them at length. In both
settings, we have the concept of a \emph{basis} or \emph{generating
set} where linear combinations of a set of vectors generate an
entire space. However, a key difference is that in modules we do
not have the concept of linear independence. Rather, there is no
well-defined notion of dimension for a module. As a result, when
reading about modules, some of the traditional concepts from linear
algebra over fields apply, but not all do. Note that linear algebra
over $\mathbb{Z}$ is easier than linear algebra over $\Z{n}$ because
the integers form a \emph{principal integral domain} (PID), allowing
the construction of the field of fractions $\mathbb{Q}$; however,
$\Z{n}$ is not a PID and thus no field of fractions exists. For a
systematic treatment of modules, please see \todo{citation needed}. In
our work, we use SageMath~\cite{sagemath} (version 7.5.1)
to perform the needed computations over $\Z{64}$.

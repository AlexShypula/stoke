- A counterexample for missing edge might not give a correct edge if it
segfaults.  This can happen because at POG state X the invariant doesn't
capture the condition to ensure that the program does not segfault.  Rather, it
captures what must be true in this point of the execution.  The POG doesn't
model the ways that a program can fail. (maybe it should?)

- Timeouts on invariants

- Timeouts on edge exhaustion

- Complexity/number of invariants that handle branch conditions 
  (affects implementation, but also performance in solvers)

- Linear algebra times out
